''' The connection management module

Nodes in the Neverland cluster shall complete a fake connection before
they start to communicate with each other. Within establishing this
connection, the initiator shall send an IV to the recipient. And then,
they will use this IV in encryption. So, actually the connection is
bound with the encryption, connections are like channels with unique
IVs that link nodes into a web.


Details of connection management:
    The connection is node-to-node but not core-to-core, but all
    functionalities of communication is in the core and one node
    may have multiple cores (in multiple workers). So this means
    we need to build the connection on node layer and all core
    objects in the node shall share it.

    Due to the limitation of SharedMemoryManager's implementation,
    we cannot simply share the Cryptor object between cores.

    So the solution is sharing IV and IV duration between cores.

    At the initial stage of a node, each node have a default IV that
    derived from the password. This IV will be used to establish the
    initial connection. After it, the initial IV will be placed aside
    and the node will start to communicate with other node with the
    new IV of initial connection. Once the IV of initial connection
    exceeds its duration, next connection will be established with the
    last IV, but the last connection and its IV will not be removed
    immediately, it will be kept until the third connection is established.

    During the whole process, we will keep at most 2 connections between
    2 nodes and once the third connection is established, the first one
    will be removed. And the default IV will never be removed, it's only
    used to establish the initial connection.

    So, the mind mapping is like this:

        +------------+
        | Default IV |
        +------------+

                     +--------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
                     | Slot-0       |   | Slot-1       |   | Slot-2       |
         Removed     |              |   |              |   |              |
        +--------+   |  +--------+  |   |  +--------+  |   |  +--------+  |
        | IV n-1 |<--|  |  IV n  |  |<--|  | IV n+1 |  |<--|  |incoming|  |
        +--------+   |  +--------+  |   |  +--------+  |   |  +--------+  |
                     |              |   |              |   |   unusable   |
